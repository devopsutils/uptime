## Getting started

`uptime` is easy to deploy to your AWS account, with a one-liner for deployment.

1. Make sure that the `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_PROFILE` environment variables are set, or that you have the appropriate AWS region and credentials configured elsewhere in your environment

2. Make sure that you have `node` and `npm`

3. Clone this repository, with `git clone https://github.com/khalidx/uptime`

4. Run the following command to build and deploy:

```sh
npm install && npm run deploy
```

After deployment, the `WebsiteUrl` for the status page and the `ServiceEndpoint` for the API will be logged to the console.

If you are just trying out `uptime`, you can easily remove it from your AWS account with `npm run undeploy`.

> **Public vs VPC deployments**

By default, the status page site will be **accessible to the internet**.

If you'd like the site to only be accessible within your AWS network, set the following variables in the `serverless.yml` file before deployment.

```yaml
...
custom:
  uptime:
    privacy: vpc
    vpc: <your-vpc-id>
...
```

### Components

- `src/app/` (the uptime serverless application backend)
- `src/ui/` (the uptime web application frontend)

### Usage

Prerequisites:

- `node` and `npm`
- Ensure the `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_PROFILE` environment variables are set, or that you have the appropriate AWS region and credentials configured elsewhere in your environment.

#### clone

Clone the repository from GitHub.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/khalidx/uptime && cd uptime
```

#### install

Install the project dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

#### deploy

Deploy the application and site to AWS.

```sh
npm run deploy
```

#### dev

Starts the project with a development server and hot-reload, for developing the backend and front-end, locally.

```sh
npm run undeploy
```

#### docker

Alternatively, build, deploy the backend, and run the UI with Docker.

Make sure to provide your AWS credentials and target region as build arguments.

```sh
docker build \
--build-arg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-aws-key> \
--build-arg AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-aws-secret> \
--build-arg AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
-t uptime .

docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 uptime
```
